Java Configuration
	instead of configuring spring container with Spring.xml
	Configure Spring Container with Java Code(No XML file)
	
3 ways
	i)  Full XML Config
	ii) Xml Component SCAN
	iii)Java Configuration Class
	
Development Process
	1) Create Java Class and Annotate as @Configaration	
		@Configaration
		public class SportConfig
		{
		.
		.
		}
	2) Add Component Scanning Support : @ComponentScan(Optional)
		@Configaration
		@ComponentScan("Package name")//package to scan
		public class SportConfig
		{
		.
		.
		}
	3) Read Spring Java Configuration Class
		AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext("sportConfig.class");
	4) Retrieve Bean From Spring Container
		Coach theCoach = context.getBean("tennisCoach", Coach.class);
		
		
Development Process
	1) Define method to expose bean
		@Configaration
		public class SportConfig
		{
		@Bean
		public Coach swimCoach()
			{
		SwimCoach mySwimCoach = new SwinCoach();
		return mySwimCoach;//create instance of SwimCoach and return
			}
		}
	2) inject bean dependencies
		@Configaration
		public class SportConfig
		{
		@Bean
		public FortuneService happyFortuneService()
			{
			return new HappyFortuneService();
			}
		@Bean
		public Coach swimCoach()
			{
		SwimCoach mySwimCoach = new SwinCoach(happyFortuneService());
		return mySwimCoach;//inject happyFortuneService()
			}
		}
	
	3) Read Spring Java Configuration class
	AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = 
				new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SportConfig.class);
	
	4) Retrieve bean from Spring Container
	Coach theCoach = context.getBean("swimCoach",Coach.class);
	//swimCoach bean ID
